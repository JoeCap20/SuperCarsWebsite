                <h2>Why I Linked the Homepages</h2>
                <p>
                    I linked the homepages so if anyone coming to these webpages want to learn more or find a dealership for one of these cars they will
                    easily be able to go to it by clicking the links I have provided. For the Lamborgini website someone can see how they can customize it 
                    and see the in's and out's of every different model they offer. On the Pagani site someone can see the different models they have, they 
                    can see the jobs that are offered and special products they are working on. On both websites someone can also see all the dealerships 
                    that are located around the world so they can find the closes one to them. 
                </p>
