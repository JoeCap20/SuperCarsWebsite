# SuperCarsWebsiteClassProject
This project has has a main index.html page and then three supporting html pages linking to it.
The first page shows the history of both of the two car brands as well as the specs.
The second page is an alternate design using different css from the main page.
The third page explains why those car brands our my favorite.
The fourth page links the actual car websites so someone can go to them.
