                <h1>History of Both Car Brands</h1>
                <p>Lamborghini started as a tractor making buisness after World War 2 and used the surplus of military 
                    machines for parts for the tractors. The creater started having problems with his Ferrari and decided 
                    he was going to create his own rival sports car company. The company started in 1963 in Italy and has 
                    been a growing company ever since.
                </p>
                <p>Pagani started in 1992. The founder always loved cars at a young age and had a dream of building a 
                   supercar. The founder started working for Lamborghini and then he went out on his own after he helped them 
                   build the Countach. The founder of Pagani wanted to make light cars out of carbon fiber in order to make
                   them faster.
